# Dropbox client for Emacs

One day, I suddenly found that, I have a Dropbox account!

And, there are many interesting docs on it, which I uploaded maybe many years ago. Now, I want to read/edit them, it's amazing.

A good dropbox client on Linux? I searched and no good choise.

So why not do the stuff in Emacs? Then I found this: https://github.com/pavpanchekha/dropbox.el

But sadly, it's not working well for me. So I re-write this as my personal solution :)

## Features

- Simple and basic, good use experience (Aim)
- Use `dired` to manage files
- Use `tramp-like style` to view/edit files

## Usage

Install, config and use:
1. Download `dropbox.el` and load it (with `load` or `require`)
2. The first time, you should generate the config file to provide auth info with `M-x dropbox-gen-config` (You can reuse the one generated by `dropbox_uploader.sh`, it's compatible)
3. Then use `M-x dropbox-find` to search and pick file, or use `C-x C-f /db:[PATH-on-DROPBOX]` to open
4. Use `M-x dropbox-browser` to view current dropbox directory in browser, interactively

Some operations in dired:
+ `D`: delete file/directory
+ `C`: from remote to remote is copy, from remote to local is download, from local to remote is upload
+ `R`: like `C` but for rename/move
+ `C`: directory from remote to local and named as `*.zip`, will be compressed and downloaded
+ `+`: make directory
+ `C-x C-f path-not-exist.txt`: create new file (when save)

## Learned from this development

- Generic function is flexible, I like it.
- Very clever for Emacs to use `file-name-handler-alist` do the dispatching operation.
- `url-retrieve` is both demon and angel, however I've mastered it.
- Coding system is another troublesome thing, but not so hard.

Thank you all to teach me a lot:

## Unresovled problems

- [ ] When opening a remote file, warning `File exists, but cannot be read`, boring but can't locate

## Anything else?

For me, it's enough. Yet, issues and PRs are welcome.

Enjoy.
